    "Now that you've seen a little bit of the bash shell and cloned a Git repository from GitHub, its time to practice a full workflow cycle in a little more detail. In this lesson, we'll start by taking a look at how to create a new Git repository if you are not working from an existing one. From there, we'll further investigate how the concepts of `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` work in practice.\n",

    "1.  Create a directory (GitHub doesn't tell you to do this, but we want to organize and contain what we're sending to the web) \n",
    "2.  `echo \"# git_practice\" >> README.md`: `echo` is a bash command which will create a markdown file `README.md` with the text `\"# git_practice\"` \n",
    "3. `git init`: This turns the current directory into a Git repository\n",
    "4. `git add README.md`: Now that the current folder is a Git repository from `git init`, we can add files for Git to track \n",
    "5. `git commit -m \"first commit\"`: Once files have been added to Git, we commit them. The `-m` option is for leaving a comment which is required \n",
    "6. `git remote add origin url_goes_here`: By default, git does not have to be connected to an online platform like GitHub. You can use Git locally for version control too. There are also other online Git platforms like Bitbucket and GitLab. Here, you're adding a link to GitHub's online hosting so that you can also sync your work with the cloud. This is super handy for sharing your work with others, collaborating, or any of the other reasons why cloud services are used \n",

To do this, type `git push origin main`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are wondering what `main` is, it's the name of our branch. You can use branches in git to separate versions of code from each other. A common example comes from web development for production environments. The `main` branch usually contains the working code for the website or app in production, and then other branches can be created for developing updates and new features, while not breaking the current working version. `main` is the default branch for all Git repositories, and we'll take a further look into branches in general in the upcoming lessons."
